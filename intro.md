A. Technologies:
- IBM's VPC, Compute, Function, Database, Hypeledger Fabric blockchain, PowerAI
- Using smart device's location, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensors

B. Solutions
Case:
- There are numbers of traffic accidents in Vietnam reasoned by cars/bikes over-speed,  driving illegally zigzagging, drivers using alcohol, stimulants, failing brake
- Cars and transportations always in over-loaded
- Bikes and cars over-speed, and drive illegally zigzagging
- Bikes, cars, and transportations used to failed to brake while in high speed


Solution:
- Position which transporting identity in what speed, location, position.
- Alert/predict to alert people's smart phones (on road) while other bikes, cars, and transportations  are driven poiting at/near/targetting you in high speed.
- Alert to administrative agent about identities who are over over-loaded, over-speed, and drive illegally zigzagging

Better than other sulutions:
- Less and there is not much IT for traffic accident predicting or alerting
