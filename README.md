This is ASTA - a blockchain based system alerting risk on Vietnam transportation accidents.

Video demo: <updating>

## PreInstall
You should have account on IBM's VPC, Compute, Function, Database, Hypeledger Fabric blockchain, PowerAI, IBM Analytics Engine, Db2, Watson to read write.

Of course you should have npm, node, react-app installed.

### Install local

Clone this git, then install run:
### `npm install`

Test on local:8078
### `npm start`


----------------------------------------
## Intro
There are numbers of traffic accidents in Vietnam reasoned by cars/bikes over-speed,  driving illegally zigzagging, drivers using alcohol, stimulants, failing brake

This version for: Alert/predict to alert people's smart phones (on road) if there is a harmful transporting signal pointing to them.

Next version for: analytic customer's need, report administrative tasks

## Technologies:
- IBM's VPC, Compute, Function, Database, Hypeledger Fabric blockchain, PowerAI, IBM Analytics Engine, Db2, Watson
- Using smart device's location, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensors

----------------------------------------
## Solution by cases
Case:
- There are numbers of traffic accidents in Vietnam reasoned by cars/bikes over-speed,  driving illegally zigzagging, drivers using alcohol, stimulants, failing brake
- Cars and transportations always in over-loaded
- Bikes and cars over-speed, and drive illegally zigzagging
- Bikes, cars, and transportations used to failed to brake while in high speed


Solution:
- Position which transporting identity in what speed, location, position.
- Alert/predict to alert people's smart phones (on road) while other bikes, cars, and transportations are driven poiting at/near/targetting you in high speed.
- Alert to administrative agent about identities who are over over-loaded, over-speed, and drive illegally zigzagging

Better than other sulutions:
- Less and there is not much IT for traffic accident predicting or alerting


Any comments are appreciated.
